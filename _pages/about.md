* I am a fifth-year PhD student in [Computer Science department](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/), advised by Prof. [He Zhu](https://herowanzhu.github.io/). My research interests involve reinforcement learning, computer vision, programming language and machine learning. I investigate to increase efficiency of neural program synthesis and apply programs of neural module to enhance robustness and interpretability of reinforcement learning policy. I also investigate to apply reinforcement learning methods for performance enhancing of deep learning models, including large language model finetuning, active learning, etc..

* I obtained my Master's degree from University of [Rochester CS](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/), advised by Prof. [Chenliang Xu](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~cxu22/).
