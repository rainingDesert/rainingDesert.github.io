* I am a third-year PhD student in [Computer Science department](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/), advised by Prof. [He Zhu](https://herowanzhu.github.io/). My research interests are neurosymbolic learning, machine learning and programming language. I investigate to increase efficiency of neural program synthesis and apply programs with neural modules as more interpretable methods to solve deep learning problem. I also leverage neurosymbolic method to reinforcement learning for robust and reliable policy.

* I obtained my Master's degree from University of [Rochester CS](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/), advised by Prof. [Chenliang Xu](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~cxu22/).
